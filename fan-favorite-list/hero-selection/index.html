    <h3> The Importance of Hero Selection </h3>

    <p> In order to understand team composition, hero selection must be taken into consideration. </p>
    <p> We here at Overwatchers Anonymous believe in one, and only one, strategy for hero selection: </p>

    <h2><strong> DON'T PICK SOMEONE YOU'VE NEVER TRAINED WITH BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!! </strong></h2>

    <p> This will encourage you to go through practice and arcade modes which, unlike quickplay and competitive, will keep your integrity and pride in check. </p>

    <p> However, if you choose to ignore us, go ahead! We certainly won't judge.....at least until your entire squad gets demoted to silver. </p>
    <p> But seriously, don't say we didn't warn you! </p>
