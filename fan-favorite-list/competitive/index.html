    <h3> Competitive 101 </h3>

    <p> Nothing will raise your blood pressure faster than watching your rank fall faster than a skydiver without a parachute. Yes, we're talking about competitive. </p>

    <p> Not only do you get to meet people from around the world, you can also get called out, harrassed, and downright embarrased by people who obviously play more Overwatch than you do. </p>

    <p> Some tips for succeeding in Competitive Overwatch: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> Find the highest-leveled player on your team and befriend them. </li>
      <li> If unsuccessful, try the next highest player. Not everyone playing Competitive is a jerk...well... </li>
      <li> Try to participate as much as you can, unless you're new to Competitive. Bring the team down and some will make it their goal to question your existence. </li>
      <li> Have fun, or at least try to! Overwatch is the best game in the world right now! </li>
    </ol>
