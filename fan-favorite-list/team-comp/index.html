    <h3> Team Composition: Does it Matter? </h3>

    <p> Ah, yes, the final and most controversial topic here at Overwatchers Anonymous. </p>
    <p> Now some would argue that team composition is an absolute joke (I myself have beaten VERY capable teams while my entire squad used defensive characters). However, if you want to have any chance of ranking up, you'd best coordinate some type of composition with your teammates, even if it is a joke. </p>

    <p> Now, obviously you'd think to have one of each class (offense, defense, tank, and support), but with 6 players to a team, there will be some overlap. But the best thing about Overwatch is that no matter how terrible you or your teammates are, you can fail together as a squad....because....obviously you never read up on team comp. </p>
